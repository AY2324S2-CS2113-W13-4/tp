# BookMarked

BookMarked is a desktop application designed specifically for librarians to streamline
the management of library inventory and borrower records. Optimized for use via a
Command Line Interface (CLI) while incorporating a Graphical User Interface (GUI),
BookMarked offers efficiency and speed in managing tasks. If you can type fast,
BookMarked enables you to perform inventory management tasks more swiftly than
traditional GUI-based applications.
